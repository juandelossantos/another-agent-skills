## What's Left

### In Progress

- (none)

### Planned

- Troubleshooting guide — common issues
- New skill tracks: CLI, IoT, GameDev, Container
- Self-host Google Fonts (Newsreader + JetBrains Mono)
- Copy button micro-interaction (scale + check icon)
- Promotion campaign (see development/PROMOTION-PLAN.md)

## Known Limitations

| Limitation | Impact | Workaround |
|---|---|---|
| OpenCode-first invocation | Claude/Cursor need adapter setup | `bash install.sh --agent claude` or `--agent cursor` |
| No automated testing | Breaks not caught until user report | Manual testing after every change |
| English/Spanish only | Other language speakers limited | Core principles are language-agnostic |
