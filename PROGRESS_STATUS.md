## What's Left

### In Progress

- **Phase 4: Docs Honesty** — Updating all docs surfaces to reflect Phase 3 completion and current warning counts.

### Completed

- **Phase 3: Output Contracts** — All 57 skills now have standardized Output Contracts declaring artifact, format, location, and quality criteria. Check 16 warnings: 37 → 0. Word count advisories resolved: 4 → 0. Guides improved: CONTRACT-TEMPLATES.md (+WebSocket, +module boundaries), VERSIONING-STRATEGIES.md (+breaking rules, +edge cases), WORKFLOW-SCENARIOS.md (+6 browser testing scenarios).
- **Phase QS: Quick Start Guide** — User-facing workflow guide, full Spanish i18n (60 keys), nav chain fixed across 13 docs pages, COMMIT_APPROVED gate restored, README prominent link.
- **Phase 2: Complete Critical Stubs** — 15 stub skills completed with full content, workflows, and guides. `visual-frontend-mastery` merged into `frontend-ui-engineering` (57 skills). 
- **Phase 1: Foundation Repair** — 29 descriptions quoted (YAML-safe), 4 stray lines cleaned, 23 flat guides moved to `guides/`. Pre-flight blocks on `main`. ANSI colors fixed in all scripts. 13/13 test suites.

### Planned

- Troubleshooting guide — common issues
- New skill tracks: CLI, IoT, GameDev, Container
- Self-host Google Fonts (Newsreader + JetBrains Mono)
- Copy button micro-interaction (scale + check icon)
- Promotion campaign (see development/PROMOTION-PLAN.md)

## Known Limitations

| Limitation | Impact | Workaround |
|---|---|---|---|
| OpenCode-first invocation | Claude/Cursor need adapter setup | `bash install.sh --agent claude` or `--agent cursor` |
| English/Spanish only | Other language speakers limited | Core principles are language-agnostic |
