# Triage Checklist

Work through these steps in order. Do not skip steps.

## Step 1: Reproduce

Make the failure happen reliably. If you can't reproduce it, you can't fix it with confidence.

```
Can you reproduce the failure?
├── YES → Proceed to Step 2
└── NO
    ├── Gather more context (logs, environment details)
    ├── Try reproducing in a minimal environment
    └── If truly non-reproducible, document conditions and monitor
```

**When a bug is non-reproducible:**

```
Cannot reproduce on demand:
├── Timing-dependent?
│   ├── Add timestamps to logs around the suspected area
│   ├── Try with artificial delays (setTimeout, sleep) to widen race windows
│   └── Run under load or concurrency to increase collision probability
├── Environment-dependent?
│   ├── Compare Node/browser versions, OS, environment variables
│   ├── Check for differences in data (empty vs populated database)
│   └── Try reproducing in CI where the environment is clean
├── State-dependent?
│   ├── Check for leaked state between tests or requests
│   ├── Look for global variables, singletons, or shared caches
│   └── Run the failing scenario in isolation vs after other operations
└── Truly random?
    ├── Add defensive logging at the suspected location
    ├── Set up an alert for the specific error signature
    └── Document the conditions observed and revisit when it recurs
```

For test failures:
```bash
npm test -- --grep "test name"
npm test -- --verbose
npm test -- --testPathPattern="specific-file" --runInBand
```

## Step 2: Localize

Narrow down WHERE the failure happens:

```
Which layer is failing?
├── UI/Frontend     → Check console, DOM, network tab
├── API/Backend     → Check server logs, request/response
├── Database        → Check queries, schema, data integrity
├── Build tooling   → Check config, dependencies, environment
├── External service → Check connectivity, API changes, rate limits
└── Test itself     → Check if the test is correct (false negative)
```

**Use bisection for regression bugs:**
```bash
git bisect start
git bisect bad
git bisect good <known-good-sha>
git bisect run npm test -- --grep "failing test"
```

## Step 3: Reduce

Create the minimal failing case:

- Remove unrelated code/config until only the bug remains
- Simplify the input to the smallest example that triggers the failure
- Strip the test to the bare minimum that reproduces the issue

A minimal reproduction makes the root cause obvious and prevents fixing symptoms instead of causes.

## Step 4: Fix the Root Cause

Fix the underlying issue, not the symptom:

```
Symptom: "The user list shows duplicate entries"

Symptom fix (bad):
  → Deduplicate in the UI component: [...new Set(users)]

Root cause fix (good):
  → The API endpoint has a JOIN that produces duplicates
  → Fix the query, add a DISTINCT, or fix the data model
```

Ask: "Why does this happen?" until you reach the actual cause.

## Step 5: Guard Against Recurrence

Write a test that catches this specific failure:

```typescript
it('finds tasks with special characters in title', async () => {
  await createTask({ title: 'Fix "quotes" & <brackets>' });
  const results = await searchTasks('quotes');
  expect(results).toHaveLength(1);
});
```

## Step 6: Verify End-to-End

```bash
npm test -- --grep "specific test"
npm test
npm run build
```
