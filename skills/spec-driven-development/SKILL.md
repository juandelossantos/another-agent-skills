# Spec-Driven Development

**Native pipeline.** This is the default path for all new features and projects. Not a skill you "decide to use."

**No specification, no code.** Forces clarity through research, critical questioning, and documented decisions.

## When NOT to Use

Single-line fixes, typo corrections, truly trivial changes (1 file, < 10 lines, no logic). For everything else, run the pipeline.

## Output Contract

| Artifact | Format | Location | Quality Criteria |
|---|---|---|---|
| SPEC.md specification + implemented code | Markdown document with 10 sections + source code | Root (`SPEC.md`) + `src/` | INTENT.md checked before spec (P0 gate), research with current year sources (P2), architecture decided with trade-offs (P3), SPEC.md has all 10 sections (Objective, Research, Architecture, Stack, Commands, Structure, Style, Testing, Acceptance Criteria, Boundaries), plan reviewed by user (P5), tasks broken with acceptance criteria (P6), explicit "yes" before code (P8→P10), spec committed alongside code, success criteria testable |

## Pipeline (Prompt → Code)

### P0 — Discovery Gate (MANDATORY)

**Check `INTENT.md` before anything else.**

| State | Action |
|---|---|
| `INTENT.md` exists, all 5 dimensions ≥80% | Read it. Proceed to P1. |
| `INTENT.md` exists, any dimension <80% | Note gaps. Ask user to fill or proceed with uncertainty. |
| `INTENT.md` missing | BLOCK. Message: "Discovery gate: INTENT.md missing. Run `interview-me` first or add NOINTENT override." |

Override: `NOINTENT: reason` in commit body for trivial changes.

### P1 — Context Assessment
Check `SPEC.md`. Exists → read, extend. Missing → new spec.
If existing code: check `HEALTH-CHECK.md` age. >7 days → re-audit via `project-health-check`.
Assess complexity: Simple (skip P2 onwards). Non-trivial (full). Complex (inline `architecture-analysis`).

### P2 — Domain Research (Non-Trivial)
Search best practices for [domain/technology] [current year]. **Always use current year. Never hardcode.** Common pitfalls, architecture patterns, latest versions. Present as context, not prescription.

**Use template:**
```
RESEARCH FINDINGS:
1. [Technology/Pattern]: Projects like yours typically use [X] because [reason].
2. [Domain Insight]: [Specific insight].
3. [Risk]: [Common pitfall]. Mitigation: [approach].
→ Does this match your understanding?
```

### P3 — Structured Clarification (MANDATORY before plan)

After research and before deep discovery, systematically identify underspecified areas: **Coverage scan** (flag vague nouns/verbs/numbers), **Sequential questioning** (one question per gap, record in `SPEC.md` Clarifications section), **Skip option** (if user says "spike/exploratory" — note it, proceed). Only proceed after all gaps closed or explicitly waived.

### P4 — Deep Discovery (MANDATORY)
Read `guides/DISCOVERY-GUIDE.md`. Surface 5+ assumptions. Ask 6 questions (objective, scope, context, constraints, stack, success metrics). Challenge: over-engineering, XY problems, scope creep, missing context. Lock with explicit "yes."

### P5 — Architecture Decision Gate
Non-trivial → invoke `architecture-analysis`. Simple → note "Standard stack per platform skill."

**Architecture gate template:**
```
Before writing the spec, we need to lock architecture.
The spec depends on: frontend framework, backend approach, data layer, auth strategy, deployment target.
```

### P6 — Write SPEC.md
Read `guides/SPEC-TEMPLATE-GUIDE.md`. 10 sections: Objective, Research, Architecture, Stack, Commands, Structure, Style, Testing, Acceptance Criteria, Boundaries. Success criteria MUST be testable.

### P7 — Plan
Components, dependencies, order, risks, verification checkpoints. User must review.

### P8 — Tasks
Discrete chunks. Each: acceptance criteria, verification step, file list. Max ~5 files per task.

**Task template:**
```markdown
- [ ] Task: [Description]
  - Acceptance: [What must be true when done]
  - Verify: [How to confirm]
  - Files: [Which files will be touched]
```

### P9 — Environment Audit
Check `docs/DEV-ENVIRONMENT.md`. Missing → invoke `dev-environment-audit`. Verify Node.js, package manager, Git, test tools.

### P10 — Implement Gate (MANDATORY)
Full stop. Confirm: SPEC ✅ | PLAN ✅ | TASKS ✅ | ARCH ✅ | ENV ✅.
Require explicit "yes" / "sí" / "proceed" / "let's go". Invalid: "ok" / "sure".
Only then invoke `incremental-implementation` + `test-driven-development`.

After completion, log `LOG METRIC: gate — result: pass` and `LOG METRIC: discovery — duration, questions_asked, user_confirms`.

**Quick reference:** `guides/SPEC-FLOW.md` for one-page pipeline visualization.

### P11 — Convergence (post-implementation)

After implementation, verify codebase matches spec. Check each acceptance criterion, flag unplanned features, generate convergence report. See `references/CONVERGENCE-EXAMPLE.md` for full report template. If gaps found, create tasks through P7. If clean, spec is done until next iteration.

---

## Multi-Agent Integration

Delegate phases via `multi-agent-orchestration`: P0-P4 (orchestrator), P5 (subagent writes SPEC.md), P6-P7 (subagent plans tasks), P9 (parallel per module). Each subagent receives only the relevant skill.

---

## Keeping the Spec Alive

Update spec first, then code. Commit alongside code. Reference in PRs. Revisit in retrospectives.

---

## Integration Map

| Phase | Skill to Inline |
|---|---|---|
| P0 (discovery gate) | `interview-me` |
| P1 (existing code) | `project-health-check` |
| P5 (non-trivial) | `architecture-analysis` |
| P7-P8 | `planning-and-task-breakdown` |
| P9 | `dev-environment-audit` |
| P10 (parallel) | `multi-agent-orchestration` |
| After P10 | `incremental-implementation`, `test-driven-development` |

---

## Common Rationalizations

| Excuse | Why It's Wrong |
|---|---|
| "Too simple for a spec." | 2-line spec prevents ambiguity. |
| "Impatient user, skip research." | Research takes minutes. Rebuilding due to bad assumptions takes hours. |
| "I'll spec after coding." | That's docs. Value is forcing clarity BEFORE code. |
| "Spec slows us down." | 20 min spec prevents hours rework. |
| "User said just build it." | Ask: "5 minutes of planning saves hours — ok?" |
| "Requirements will change anyway." | That's why it's a living doc. Outdated spec > no spec. |

---

## Red Flags

Code before SPEC.md. Research skipped for non-trivial. Phase 9 bypassed with vague "ok." Clarification skipped without explicit waiver. Features added that weren't in spec. Agent asks "start building?" before defining "done." `[year]` without "current" prefix.

---

## Verification

- [ ] SPEC.md exists with 10 sections
- [ ] Plan reviewed by user
- [ ] Tasks broken with acceptance criteria
- [ ] User said explicit "yes" before code
- [ ] Success criteria are testable
- [ ] Spec committed alongside code
- [ ] Metrics logged after Phase 10
- [ ] Convergence check done after implementation (P11)
- [ ] `INTENT.md` checked before spec (Discovery Gate P0)
- [ ] `[current year]` used in research (not hardcoded year)
