# Test Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Testing implementation details | Tests break when refactoring even if behavior is unchanged | Test inputs and outputs, not internal structure |
| Flaky tests (timing, order-dependent) | Erode trust in the test suite | Use deterministic assertions, isolate test state |
| Testing framework code | Wastes time testing third-party behavior | Only test YOUR code |
| Snapshot abuse | Large snapshots nobody reviews, break on any change | Use snapshots sparingly and review every change |
| No test isolation | Tests pass individually but fail together | Each test sets up and tears down its own state |
| Mocking everything | Tests pass but production breaks | Prefer real implementations > fakes > stubs > mocks. Mock only at boundaries where real deps are slow or non-deterministic |

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "I'll write tests after the code works" | You won't. And tests written after the fact test implementation, not behavior. |
| "This is too simple to test" | Simple code gets complicated. The test documents the expected behavior. |
| "Tests slow me down" | Tests slow you down now. They speed you up every time you change the code later. |
| "I tested it manually" | Manual testing doesn't persist. Tomorrow's change might break it with no way to know. |
| "The code is self-explanatory" | Tests ARE the specification. They document what the code should do, not what it does. |
| "It's just a prototype" | Prototypes become production code. Tests from day one prevent the "test debt" crisis. |
| "Let me run the tests again just to be extra sure" | After a clean test run, repeating the same command adds nothing unless the code has changed since. |

## Red Flags

- Writing code without any corresponding tests
- Tests that pass on the first run (they may not be testing what you think)
- "All tests pass" but no tests were actually run
- Bug fixes without reproduction tests
- Tests that test framework behavior instead of application behavior
- Test names that don't describe the expected behavior
- Skipping tests to make the suite pass
- Running the same test command twice in a row without any intervening code change
