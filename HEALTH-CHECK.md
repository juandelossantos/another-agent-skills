## Rules & Reliability

### Mechanical Enforcement

| Mechanism | Type | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Rule 12: Pre-commit hook** | Shell script (v6) | ✅ Blocks `git commit` without hash-verified `.git/COMMIT_APPROVED` token |
| **9 pre-commit gates** | Shell script | ✅ Pre-flight, HTML integrity, token hash, build verify, anti-slop, debug strikes, SPEC |
| **Commit Manifest Protocol** | Process rule | ✅ Visible block before every commit |
| **Post-commit verification** | Process rule | ✅ Build, tests, regressions after each commit |
| **Rule 0d: Pre-action checklist** | Process rule | ✅ Verbalized before destructive actions |
| **Rule 12b: PR Review Gate** | Process rule | ✅ `pr-review-checklist.sh` before merge |
| **3 Strikes Protocol** | GUIDE.md (lazy) | ✅ Systematic diagnosis after 3 failed fixes |
| **Self-review principle** | ADR-001 | ✅ Mandatory for changes > 50 lines |
| **Native plugin hooks** | TypeScript | ✅ editGuard, preFlight, commitApproval, sessionCompact |

### Process Safeguards

| Check | Status |
|---|---|
| Commit and push are SEPARATE decisions | ✅ |
| Invalid responses defined (ok/sigamos/continue = NOT valid) | ✅ |
| Session-level lock: no "approved mode" | ✅ |
| 25+ anti-rationalization excuses against skipping gates | ✅ |
| Incident documentation for violations | ✅ INCIDENT_001, INCIDENT_002, INCIDENT_003 |

## Token & Context Management

### Always-Loaded (every session)

| File | Lines | Tokens (est.) | % of 200K |
|---|---|---|---|
| `AGENTS.md` | 429 | ~6,435 | 3.2% |
| `AGENTS-EXTENDED.md` | 280 | ~4,200 | 2.1% |
| **Subtotal** | **429** | **~6,435** | **3.2%** |

### Loaded On-Demand

| Item | Lines | Tokens | Condition |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 active SKILL.md | ~143 (avg) | ~2,145 | Per skill invocation |
| 0-2 guides | ~0-200 | ~0-3,000 | Per phase reached |

### Typical Session Budget

| Component | Tokens |
|---|---|
| AGENTS.md | ~6,435 |
| 1 active skill | ~2,145 |
| 0-1 guides | ~1,500 |
| Conversation + history (~30 msgs) | ~60,000 |
| User code (~500 lines) | ~10,000 |
| **Total** | **~72,080 (36%)** |

**Margin:** ~64% available for debugging, extra skills, large codebases, or extended conversations.

### Context Management Features

| Feature | Location | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Rule 0e: Context Compression & Eviction | AGENTS.md | ✅ |
| SESSION_CONTEXT archiving | AGENTS.md Rule 0e | ✅ |
| Lazy loading (skills as index + guides) | AGENTS.md Rule 6 | ✅ |
| Context budget (60/25/15 split) | AGENTS.md Rule 8 | ✅ |
| History compaction (>20 msgs → 3 points) | AGENTS.md Rule 8 | ✅ |
| Context > 70% → stop loading guides | AGENTS.md Rule 0e | ✅ |
| Never evict: active skill, user code, errors | AGENTS.md Rule 0e | ✅ |

## Skill Health

### Size Distribution

| Range | Count | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 200-250 lines | 9 | ✅ Optimal |
| 100-199 lines | 17 | ✅ Good |
| 50-99 lines | 12 | ⚠️ Thin — could use expansion |
| < 50 lines | 0 | ✅ None |

### Thin Skills (under 100 lines)

These skills are functional but could benefit from expansion:

| Skill | Lines | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| `debugging-three-strikes` | 20 | Low (micro-skill, intentionally short) |
| `output-skill` | 48 | Low (micro-skill) |
| `redesign-skill` | 60 | Medium |
| `documentation-and-adrs` | 62 | Low |
| `debugging-and-error-recovery` | 63 | **High** — core lifecycle skill |
| `soft-premium-ui` | 65 | Low (design skin) |
| `git-workflow-and-versioning` | 66 | **High** — core lifecycle skill |
| `minimalist-ui` | 68 | Low (design skin) |
| `industrial-brutalist-ui` | 71 | Low (design skin) |
| `test-driven-development` | 72 | **High** — core lifecycle skill |
| `code-review-and-quality` | 79 | Medium |
| `multi-agent-orchestration` | 80 | Medium |

**Action:** Expand `debugging-and-error-recovery`, `git-workflow-and-versioning`, and `test-driven-development` to 120+ lines each (planned for v1.5.0).

## Usefulness for Different Project Types

### Skill Coverage

| Project Type | Skills Invoked | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Landing page** | spec + git-init + frontend-web (+ light architecture) | ✅ |
| **Web app** | Full lifecycle | ✅ |
| **Mobile app** | spec + git-init + frontend-mobile (+ backend if API) | ✅ |
| **API only** | spec + git-init + architecture + backend + shipping | ✅ |
| **Desktop app** | spec + git-init + frontend-desktop | ✅ |
| **Existing fix** | health-check + spec + debugging | ✅ |
| **Design system** | spec + git-init + frontend + shipping | ✅ |
| **MVP/prototype** | spec (turbo) + git-init + frontend | ✅ |
| **CLI tool** | spec + git-init + shipping | ✅ |
| **Open source lib** | spec + git-init + shipping + code-review | ✅ |

### Cross-Platform

| Platform | Skill | Lines |
|---|---|---|
| Web | `frontend-web` | 212 |
| Mobile | `frontend-mobile` | 240 |
| Desktop | `frontend-desktop` | 237 |
| PWA/Offline | `frontend-pwa` | 196 |

### Adaptability

- **Stack Agnosticism** (Rule 5) — reads `SPEC.md` Tech Stack to adapt examples
- **Bilingual** (Rule 10) — Spanish/English, no mixing
- **Turbo Mode** (Rule 4) — for prototypes, reduces scope not quality
- **Purpose-driven sessions** (Rule 3) — `.sessionrc` defaults per intent

---

## Recommendations

1. **⚠️ Expand 3 core lifecycle skills.** `debugging-and-error-recovery` (63 lines), `test-driven-development` (72 lines), and `git-workflow-and-versioning` (66 lines) are underdeveloped for their importance. Plan v1.5.0 addresses this.

2. **⚠️ Add tests for enforcement scripts.** `pre-flight.sh`, `edit-guard.sh`, `commit-approval.sh` have no test coverage. If they break silently, the entire enforcement chain fails. Plan v1.5.0 addresses this with BATS tests.

3. **✅ Always-loaded context reduced to 429 lines.** Down from 531 in v1.4.1. Verbose protocol details moved to AGENTS-EXTENDED.md (lazy-loaded). Context budget: 3.2% of 200K.

4. **💡 Create `SPEC.md` for this meta-project.** Optional since AGENTS.md serves as the de facto spec, but would clarify boundaries, audience, and what's out of scope.

5. **💡 Add CI pipeline.** No automated testing exists. Plan v1.5.0 addresses this.
